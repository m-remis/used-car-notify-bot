## Architecture

![arch](docs/car_notif_diagram.svg)

---

## üóÇ JSON-Based Persistence

- On startup, the app loads `users.json` and `cars.json` into memory (if present, otherwise it creates new files automatically)
- Runtime operations work directly against in-memory maps
- After each change, the app **overwrites** the respective file
- This makes the app **stateless** and restart-friendly ‚Äì no DB required

---

## üîÅ Background Job

A scheduled job (configurable) does all the heavy lifting:

1. Scrapes listings from the site using provided filters (e.g. model, price)
2. Compares against in-memory records to detect **new entries**
3. Filters for **approved** users with notifications enabled
4. Sends a **Telegram message** (caption + image) to each chat ID
