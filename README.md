# üöó Used Car Notifier Bot

Watches [usedcars.toyota.sk](https://usedcars.toyota.sk) for new listings (e.g. **Corolla**, **RAV4**)  
and sends Telegram alerts with **photos** and **prices**.

Built with **Spring Boot 3.5.3** and **Java 21**.

---

## Features

-  Scrapes listings with `Jsoup`
-  In-memory storage backed by `users.json` and `cars.json`
-  Admin approval and user management
-  Per-user notification toggle
-  Configurable price threshold and car models
-  Sends Telegram photos + captions on new listings
- Ô∏è Configurable via `application.yml`
-  No CLI needed ‚Äì manage everything via **Telegram** and **Swagger UI**

## Architecture

![arch](docs/car_notif_diagram.svg)

---

## üóÇ JSON-Based Persistence

- On startup, the app loads `users.json` and `cars.json` into memory (if present, otherwise it creates new files automatically)
- Runtime operations work directly against in-memory maps
- After each change, the app **overwrites** the respective file
- This makes the app **stateless** and restart-friendly ‚Äì no DB required

---

## üîÅ Background Jobs

A scheduled job (configurable) does all the heavy lifting:

1. Scrapes listings from the site using provided filters (e.g. model, price)
2. Compares against in-memory records to detect **new entries**
3. Filters for **approved** users with notifications enabled
4. Sends a **Telegram message** (caption + image) to each chat ID

### Architecture & Job Separation
- **Split the background workflow into two jobs**:
    - **Job A**: Scrapes and stores car data
    - **Job B**: Reads stored data, filters new listings, and sends notifications  
      This enables clearer separation of concerns and better scalability (e.g. retry Task B independently).

### Per-User Notification Tracking
- Persist **timestamp** of the last notification sent to each user (e.g., `lastNotifiedAt`).
- Allows tracking and helps prevent duplicate notifications if the job is re-run forcefully manually.

### User-Centric Filters
- Let users set **their own car model and price preferences**, instead of a global filter.

##  Potential Upgrades & TODOs

Looking ahead, here are some ideas for improvements and refactoring:

### User Interface
- Build a minimal React / Angular UI to manage users and preferences visually.

### Docker Container
- Package everything self-contained, along with a docker-compose.yml for volume-backed .json files.

### Webhook Support ‚Äî switch from polling to webhook model - absolutely not
- This thing runs 24/7 on [redneck 140‚Ç¨ undervolted Thinkpad t480](docs/chonk_pad.png) with upgraded cpu cooler from Aliexpress, 32gb dual-channel ram and clocks set to 800mhz without the fans ever spinning because I'm chill like that
